# The Abstract & Epilogue

Ambitious Experimental Database Management System written to experiment with
techniques and concepts I learn to mimic/mock (as nearly as possible) the üß†.

I will be posting new blogs under this series, each about something I learned along the
way. The repo for this series will be publicly [available](https://github.com/BirnadinErick/kopf) under my personal account. Any contibutions
are most welcome üòò

## Why

Recently I started learning about database engineering and rust-lang. I wanted
someway to test what I just learned. I am more of a...

> See for yourself guy, hence the project **kopf**

## Brief

This project is named **kopf**, meaning *head* in German. I gave it such a name
because that is what this project's design philosophy originates. **kopf**
heavily borrows functional behaviors of the human head, actually the *brian*,
but linguistic German for brain is *Gehirn*. I find it hard to pronounce, hence
**kopf** it is üòÇ.

I always inspire this beast inside each of us, it is *tunned* by the evalution,
*battle tested by the time*, astonishing *heavy-compute-powered*, *high fault
tolerant* and *self-healing* *concurrent* computer, **brain** and its
associates; litteral **head**, i.e. **kopf**.

## Design Philosophy

As mentioned above, I will base **kopf** to *human-brain*. Thus, as of now I
came up with this system:-


![kopf_v1.0.0_rc_system_design](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666196637037/HpBEXizt-.png align="center")

**kopf** will be module-based(somewhat derived from micro-services arch) and be
able to *plug-n-play* at runtime. I will equip hybrid of *spiral* and
*waterfall* sys-dev-lifecycle to suit my convienience.

Each module will have a prototype version in *python* and actual implementation
in *rust* and *C*(for legacy libs I'll use using FFI) along with some
springled *go* for network stuffs. I am using multiple languages to get a hang
of each these languages and to familiarize myself with new concepts in well
diversed ecosystem üòâ.

## Updates and Follow Ups

I am planning on blogging my journey in this train on my personal website and
personal *Hashnode* side. My journey will be called [*Forging die kopf*](https://fyi.birnadine.guru/series/forging-die-kopf),
follow me up there to get a quick grasp of what the f*@k is giong on üòÅ.
