# Plan of Attack!

For the first major version of kopf(v1.0.0) I am planning to have simple
feature set to just get it running. Following list are non-exhaustive and
may change as I please ðŸ˜‰

## Functional Requirements

1. Save/Retrieve Data from CSVs
2. Understand Basic SQL
3. Communicate via Sockets
4. Selective Indexing
5. Table Partitioning
6. Don't abandon the project in the middle ðŸ˜‚ when interest is lost

## Non Functional Requirements

1. Optimal Latency
2. Less IOps
3. Small memory footprint
4. Scheduled Backup (ðŸ¤ž)

## Building the Stack

We will start from inside out. First we'll build the `cerebrum` to have
persistant datastorage then `cerebellum` for command execution and have the
`cerebrum` understand the issued *SQL*. At last, we will tie up with
`brainstem` be able to communicate with external env. using *sockets*.

*So we need to*:-

1. IO with CSV
2. Have a worker-master model with`cerebrum`-`cerebellum`
3. Socket Programming
4. Have in-memory B+Tree of CSV contents
5. An algorithm for sorting
  - *Radix* if row-count > 10000
  - *Insertion* if row-count < 1000
  - *Merge* else

## Some Design Decisions

- First of all, I will implement a prototype in *python*, then try to implement
  it in *rust*/*C*.
- I am a big fan of binaries, so Queries will be encoded to binary and 
  interpreted as is!
- I will add more As I progress!

## Deep Dive

### The cerebrum

Biologists divide `memory`-functionality of the *brain* into 3 parts. Name...

- Encode/Decode: Understand and realize what we learn and remember
- Store: Persist what we learned/remember for short-&-long --term usage
- Retrieve: Consume back what we learned/memorized

So, I will have my way at it as aforementioned! My `cerebrum` will follow
these steps. 

1. It will have a module to `en/de-code` the *SQL* issued by the `crebellum`.
2. A `short-term` in-memory caches and indexes for quick recall ops
3. Persisted in-disk CSVs for `long-term` memory
4. And a way to decide between whether to retrieve from `long` or `short`
   memory during execution of queries

#### Employed Datastructures

For in-disk, we will mimic *Apache kafka*'s `SSTables`. Any write will only be
appended without any seek. But, instead of conventional deltas, we will write
result of the query on the existing data. Then have a worker scheduled to clean
previous corresponding rows. I will coherce with the saying...

> What is Done, Is Done.

... i.e. no rollback once the transaction is committed. No fallback. No f*@k by
default. But admin/engineer can opt in to trade-off space and extra check to
eliminate old-duplicate results for high availability and fallback backups.

For in-memory, I will employ conventional B+Tree ofz.

### The cerebellum

This is captain of the ship. I want to use pub/sub models with 1-producer &
many-consumer, but let's see, what future holds. In my mind, for the first rc,
just wanna schedule function calls in a *queue* then be done about it ðŸ˜‚.

`cerebellum` will be the glue of both `brainstem` and the `cerebrum`. So, this
will be my high-hot-spot & single-point of failure if anything should go south.

### The brainstem

API to the external systems. This module will be responsible only for getting
the request from outside by *sockets* and then strip off unneccessary stuff
from the payload and only send `query` and `params` to the `cerebellum`. Take
`result` from `cerebellum` and then cooks the response and respond via
pre-established awaiting *socket* or new if client wants *asynchronous* ops.

### Payload detection in async communication

One challenge that I foresee is confusion when results donot arrive in order
as issued during async communication. So, each payload(request) from externals
will have a unique id in following format:
  <client_id::int>-<payload_id::int>
e.g. 1-1 for a client id with 1 and payload id of 1 OR 2-23 as such. **Note**,
we will impose that payload id should start from 0 or 1 to have small payload
size and be sequentially increased.

#### why not conventional cuid or uuid?

Obviously the size. *uuid* is 16 bytes long. But, an integer is just 8 bytes
litterally I can write logs in any order and in agrregation I can just sort
them with payload_id.

> Have a very good luck sorting with uuid eventhough uuid generation is seq.

In uuid case, I will have to use another operation or store them in order for
audit logs and WAL.

**I know, this is vague, I might change. If I am wrong, please do comment and
teach me using comments section**

## That's it for now. This is BE, signing off ðŸ‘‹
